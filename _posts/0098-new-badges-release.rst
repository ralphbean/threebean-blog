title: New Badges Site Release, Oct. 25
---

We just put out a new release of the `badges site
<https://badges.fedoraproject.org>`_ with a bucket of new features:

- An interface to `diff users against one another
  <https://badges.fedoraproject.org/diff/adamwill/pbrobinson>`_ (be warned,
  there are `some typos <https://github.com/fedora-infra/tahrir/pull/236>`_)
- Reports for periods of `years
  <https://badges.fedoraproject.org/report/2013>`_,
  `months <https://badges.fedoraproject.org/report/2013/10>`_,
  `weeks <https://badges.fedoraproject.org/report/2013/week/40>`_, and
  `days <https://badges.fedoraproject.org/report/2013/10/25>`_.
- FOAF metadata (as per our discussion at Flock on an `infrastructure ontology
  <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Ontology>`_.  This is just
  the beginning.)
- A profile button that lets you optionally add a URL to your homepage and
  tack on a short bio.
- Some feedback as to when you were awarded particular badges.
- And a `new badge <https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/baby-badger>`_ to
  boot.

Oh, and that bad link on the badge page? (the "last awarded to...")..?  That
`has been fixed
<https://github.com/fedora-infra/tahrir/commit/d9aff539ebbc4d2dc886fd5f1a7a0e2d#>`_.

Thanks to all `who contributed
<https://github.com/fedora-infra/tahrir/graphs/contributors>`_ to the latest
release.  If you were following the code review bonanza today, you know it was
a real team effort.
