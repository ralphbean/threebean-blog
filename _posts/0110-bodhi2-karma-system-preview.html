title: Preview of the Bodhi2 Karma System
---

<p>So I recently joined <a href="http://lewk.org">Luke Macken</a> in working on
the next release of <a
href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates">Bodhi</a>, the Fedora Updates
System.</p>

<p>Bodhi2 (here's the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bodhi/2.0">planning
  doc</a>) will include a number of new features.  This past week, I've been
working on one among them:  a more <i>fine-grained karma system</i>.</p>

<p>Here's a preview:</p>

<p><video width="600" height="350" controls="controls" preload="none">
    <source src="http://threebean.org/videos/bodhi2-karma.ogv"/>
</video></p>

<p><small>If you have problems with the video, you can download it directly
    here in <a href="http://threebean.org/videos/bodhi2-karma.ogv">ogg</a>
    format.
</small></p>

<p>If you have feedback on that, please let me know (you could write me
directly, try the <a
href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/infrastructure">infrastructure
list</a>, or jump into <code>#fedora-apps</code> on the freenode network.) If
you want to <kbd>hack</kbd> on Bodhi2, there are instructions for setting it up
locally <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/bodhi/wiki/Bodhi2">here</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is a <a
href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAD_Bodhi2_Taskotron_2014">FAD planned</a>
for early June at which I hope we'll make leagues of progress.  Cheers!</p>
