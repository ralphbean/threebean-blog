<p>It's done.  An over-engineered <a
  href="http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" target="_blank">WSGI
  middleware</a> component that adds a velociraptor to every page served.  Fact:
Every WSGI app is better with a raptor.</p>

<p>It's called <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/raptorizemw">raptorizemw</a>
(pronounced "awesome") and the only way to use it is in production.</p>
