title: TurboGears 2.1 and Foreclosures (more empty houses than homeless people)
---
<p>I wrote an app that scrapes foreclosure data from my county of residence and
plots it six ways from Sunday in a TurboGears2.1 app.  You can find it at <a

hosted on redhat's openshift cloud.</p>

<p>It's used by activists with <a href="http://takebackroc.rocus.org/">Take Back
  the Land, Rochester</a> and my local branch of the <a
  href="http://rochesteriso.org">ISO</a> to find upcoming evictions before they
happen and organize the neighborhoods to stop the shuttering of homes.  Get a
hundred people at the door of the house before the cops come, and no-one is
getting evicted (we've had <a

<a
  href="http://socialistworker.org/2011/08/23/no-eviction-for-cathy-lennon">successes</a>).</p>

<p>We're living in some absurd times where banks got bailed out by the trillions
yet still get to collect on our student debt and mortgages.  Most of us are
being ruined.  If you're not, then your neighbor is.</p>
