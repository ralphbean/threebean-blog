title: Getting the docstring of a function (without the name)
---
<p>I was using <code>argparse</code> and entry-points [console_scripts] in a
project at work and I wanted each of the 12 console scripts to have a --help
option that would display (among other things) the __doc__ of their main entry
function.  This way I wouldn't have to rewrite those docs over and over when I
added a new script.</p>

<p>I came up with this little guy:</p>

$$code(lang=python, style=monokai)
#!/usr/bin/env python
""" The module level docstring """

import inspect


def f():
    """ The function level docstring """
    print __my_doc__()


def g():
    """ Another function level docstring """
    print __my_doc__()


def __my_doc__():
    """ Print the docstring of the calling function """
    return globals()[inspect.stack()[1][0].f_code.co_name].__doc__


if __name__ == '__main__':
    f()
    g()
$$/code

<p>You could use it to, say, do:</p>

$$code(lang=python, style=monokai)
import argparse

def some_command():
    """ This command will knock your socks off! """
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__my_doc__())
    args = parser.parse_args()
    raise NotImplementedError("TODO -- gotta write this command still...")
$$/code

<p>Relying on <code>globals()</code> really sucks.  If anyone can think of a
better way to do it, let me know!</p>

<strong>EDIT -- 09/15/2011</strong>

<p>Thanks to some inspiration from <a href="http://heewa.net/">@heewa</a>, I
landed on this solution which is much more portable.</p>

$$code(lang=python, style=monokai)
import inspect

def __my_doc__(n=1):
    """ Print the docstring of the calling function.
    
    Because this function doesn't rely on :py:func:`globals()`, it is more
    portable.  It can now live in its own module and be invoked from elsewhere.
    """

    frame = inspect.stack()[n][0]
    return frame.f_globals[frame.f_code.co_name].__doc__
$$/code
