<p>This past week, work sent me to Seattle for <a
  href="http://sc11.supercomputing.org/">Supercomputing 2011</a>.</p>

<p>While there, I crashed with my sister, <a
  href="http://depts.washington.edu/complit/people/faculty/bean/">Doctor J</a>,
drank wine, did some dancing, and had a blast!  On Friday night after the wine
had set in, I tried explaining what it is I do.  It's really just <i>magic</i>,
but has to be described with words like <i>python</i>, and <i>development</i>.
I showed off <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/raptorizemw">raptorizemw</a>
and soon enough, we were getting ready to <i>chaplin-ize</i> her department's
new website!</p>

<p>Check it out at <a
  href="http://depts.washington.edu/mirg">http://depts.washington.edu/mirg</a>.
The effect only triggers once in every three page loads (on average) so if it
doesn't show, reload it a couple times.</p>
