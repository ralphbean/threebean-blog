The `toscawidgets2 24 hour bugsprint
<http://threebean.org/blog/announcing-tw2-bugsprint>`_
is this coming Saturday!  In order to get you excited and to `curry all of your
favors`, I decided to give http://toscawidgets.org a facelift.

The old http://toscawidgets.org site was confusing!  80% of the frontpage was
about toscawidgets 1 which, while stable, has a diminishing number of maintainers
and no active development.  20% of the page was a "news" bar on the right that
pointed users to "Alpha releases" and "new documentation" for tw2, timestamped
back in 2010!

I revamped it to more clearly differentiate between the two versions of the
framework and to give it a more modern look (if we're building python widget
libraries, we better be on top of CSS3 on our project page, right?)
