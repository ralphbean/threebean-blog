title: Would you use Subsidized Childcare at PyCon?
---

So, I've been mentoring for some of the Fedora projects a la the `GNOME
Outreach Program for Women <http://gnome.org/opw>`_ and I realized today that
I'd actually met one of the applicants before in person at the Sprints
at PyCon 2012.  She could only stop in to say "Hi" and couldn't participate
though; she was caring for an infant at the time. (Her husband did get to
participate).

Since the sprints are where you can build real relationships with
upstream(s), develop skills, become inspired, have an impact, find a
role model, be a role model, etc.. I thought it would be good for the conference
(or some sponsors) to provide quality, on-site childcare at the sprints.  I wrote
to `pycon-organizers <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pycon-organizers>`_
and stuff seems to be moving ahead.  `@jessenoller
