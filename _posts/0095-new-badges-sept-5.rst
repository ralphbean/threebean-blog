title: New Badges, Sept. 5

I turned on 10 new badges in the `Fedora Badges
<https://badges.fedoraproject.org>`_ backend awarder this week.

This one's my favorite:

   :target: https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/fedora-20-change-accepted

As always, you can find the badges people in ``#fedora-apps`` on freenode.
