title: Fedmsg Stream Now Available on Identica
---

I just finished setting up a fedmsg bot to post updates to `identi.ca
<https://identi.ca>`_.  You can check it out at `@fedmsgbot
<https://identi.ca/fedmsgbot/>`_.  There's also this little `realtime interface
<http://identi.ca/fedmsgbot?realtime=1>`_.

Why would this be of any interest?

 - You can check `@fedmsgbot <https://identi.ca/fedmsgbot/>`_ for a public
   timeline of the development of Fedora.
 - If you do something, and you're proud of it, you can go and "favorite" or
   "re-tweet" a message.

The code works just as well with twitter -- the bot can tweet to multiple
platforms and accounts -- but I ran into the daily maximum tweet limit with
twitter (1000 new updates per day is not enough for fedmsg).  I asked twitter if
they'd allow an exception, but was denied.  Ah, well..  If you have any
workaround ideas, let me know.
