title: New Badges, Sept. 16
---

Before I start, I have to plug that last week we presented on Mozilla's Open
Badges community conference call.  There were lots of good questions and ideas
-- the whole thing went well.  You can read more in `Mozilla's writeup
<http://openbadges.tumblr.com/post/61029544973/check-out-these-fedora-badges>`_.

Ok, ok.  The news from today is that I turned on 5 new badges in the `Fedora
Badges <https://badges.fedoraproject.org>`_ backend awarder.  This one is my
favorite from the batch:

As always, you can find the Fedora Badges people in ``#fedora-apps`` on
freenode or on our `swank mailing list
<https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/badges>`_
