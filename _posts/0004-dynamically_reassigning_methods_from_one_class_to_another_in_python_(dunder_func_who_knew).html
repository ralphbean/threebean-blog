title: dynamically reassigning methods from one class to another in python (dunder
  func, who knew?)
---
<p>I don't know if you've ever wanted to take a method from one class and attach
it to another.  I never knew I'd wanted to, but it turns out I did.</p>

$$code(lang=python, style=monokai)
#!/usr/bin/python

class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id
    
    def bar(self):
        print self.id

class Oof(object):
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id

# Wow
Oof.bar = Foo.bar.__func__

Foo(52).bar()      # prints 52
Oof(10).bar()      # prints 10
