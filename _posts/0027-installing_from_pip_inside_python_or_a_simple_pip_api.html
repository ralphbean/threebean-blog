title: Installing from pip inside python or, a simple pip API
---
<p>So, it's a long story, but my bid to <a
  href="http://threebean.org/blog/2011/04/13/using-fabric-to-manage-moksha-development/">convert
  moksha's development tools to fabric</a> was a terrible idea:  mandatory
<code>sshd</code> on dev boxes, passwords in the clear when chaining commands
between systems, simple failure to work.  It was the wrong tool for the job.
Now I have my work cut out for me to replace it with something worthwhile.</p>

<p>I have a need to invoke pip from inside python and to do it within the
current virtualenv.  I googled and found <a
  href="http://groups.google.com/group/python-virtualenv/browse_thread/thread/fd598cf91d58f298">this
  somewhat old thread</a> on the virtualenv list which indicates that there's
not much help out there.</p>

<p>Here's my stab at it.</p>

$$code(lang=python, style=monokai)
import pip.commands.install

def install_distributions(distributions):
    command = pip.commands.install.InstallCommand()
    opts, args = command.parser.parse_args()
    # TBD, why do we have to run the next part here twice before actual install
    requirement_set = command.run(opts, distributions)
    requirement_set = command.run(opts, distributions)
    requirement_set.install(opts)
$$/code

<p>And a test to see if it works.</p>

$$code(lang=python, style=monokai)
#!/usr/bin/env python

from blogmodule import install_distributions

def run_test():
    try:
        import markdown
        print "Markdown is installed!  Aborting."
        assert(False)
    except ImportError as e:
        print "Markdown isn't yet installed.  That's good."

    install_distributions(["Markdown"])

    try:
        import markdown
        print "Markdown is now installed.  That's good!"
    except ImportError as e:
        print "Markdown never got installed.  That's bad."
        assert(False)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_test()
$$/code

<p>Looking forward to doing something cool with this and python <a
  href="http://threebean.org/blog/2011/06/06/context-manager-for-python-shelve-module/">context
  managers</a> to manage <code>virtualenv</code>s.</p>
