I made a landing page for the previously barren
https://apps.fedoraproject.org/ (*however*,
it's `up only in our staging environment
<https://apps.stg.fedoraproject.org/>`_ until after the freeze).

It's built using the `Javascript Infovis Toolkit <http://thejit.org>`_.  The
data model is kept in a nice little YAML file so we can easily update it from
puppet.

If you want to toy with it, the source can be found `on github
<http://github.com/ralphbean/apps.fp.o>`_.
