title: Hacking tw2 resource injection
---
<p>Tonight, <em>VooDooNOFX</em> was asking in IRC in #turbogears how to disable
the injection of jquery.js by tw2.jquery into her/his TG2 app.  Using the
<code>inject_resources=False</code> middleware config value wouldn't cut it,
since she/he wanted tw2 to inject all <em>other</em> resources, they were
loading jQuery via google CDN beforehand and tw2's injection was clobbering
their code.</p>

<p>I came up with the following hack to <code>myapp/lib/base.py</code> which
will remove tw2.jquery.jquery_js from the list of resources tw2 would inject
into each page served by a TG2.1 app.</p>

<p>At the top of <code>myapp/lib/base.py</code> import:</p>
$$code(lang=python, style=monokai)
import tw2.core.core
import tw2.jquery
$$/code

<p>and then replace:</p>

$$code(lang=python, style=monokai)
        return TGController.__call__(self, environ, start_response)
$$/code

<p>with the following:</p>

$$code(lang=python, style=monokai)
        stream = TGController.__call__(self, environ, start_response)

        # Disable the injection of tw2.jquery
        offending_link = tw2.jquery.jquery_js.req().link
        local = tw2.core.core.request_local()
        local['resources'] = [
            r for r in local.get('resources', list()) if r.link != offending_link
        ]

        return stream
$$/code

<p>The two tricks to this are</p>

<p><ul><li>Simply knowing that tw2 resources register themselves with the
  'request_local' object and that during the return-phase of the WSGI pipeline,
  the tw2 middleware refers to that list when injecting
  resources</li><li>Figuring out where in a TG2 app's request flow to place the
  call to alter that object <strong>after</strong> all widgets that might
  register jquery have declared their resources but <strong>before</strong> the
  resources list is injected into the output stream.</li></ul></p>

<p>We came out of it with <a
  href="https://bitbucket.org/paj/tw2core/issue/94/jquery-resource-injection">a
  bug filed in the tw2 issue tracker</a> so we can take care of it properly in
the future.</p>
