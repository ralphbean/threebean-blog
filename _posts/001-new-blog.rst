title: Migrating from wordpress
---
I got fed up with wordpress and have moved to the python tool `blogofile
<http://blogofile.com/>`_.  I've been intermittently tending to my old blog
over at http://threebean.wordpress.com/ and getting traffic I'm happy with.
A lot of my old tutorials on tw2 regularly get referred to by google and my
new posts get picked up by readers of planet python and occasionally by reddit.

WordPress has become unbearable:

 - I have to edit my posts in a clumsy WSIWYG editor.
 - My posts appear in planet aggregators without proper links back to my blog
   and half-truncated.
 - My control of styling and javascript is limited.
 - I can't embed github gists.

So I'm trying out `blogofile <http://blogofile.com/>`_:

 - It supports both reStructuredText and markdown out of the box.
 - My styling and layout are handled by mako templates which I use already
   elsewhere.
 - I can keep my posts in git.
 - I can host everything in one place on http://threebean.org
