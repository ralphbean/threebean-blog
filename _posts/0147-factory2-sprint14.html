title: Factory 2, Sprint 14
---

<p>Hello all.  Bi-weekly update from the Factory 2 team on our work here.  We have three videos this sprint.</p>
<p>Two are related to the module-build-service: both on submitting builds.  We
have some new client tooling to show which should make manual submission and
monitoring of module-builds much simpler.  The second is a demo of an early
prototype of our <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Factory2/Focus/Freshmaker">continuous rebuild system</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have a demo of some early prototype work for the <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Factory2/Focus/ArbitraryBranching">arbitrary
branching</a>
proposal that we <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gqccjyjwFk">talked about at DevConf</a> back in February.</p>

<h2>pdc-sla-apis, by mprahl</h2>

<p>This demo shows an API developed to store SLA and EOL information on package branches in Product Definition Center (PDC). The API would act as a gold source for other tools that need to make decisions based on this information. The code shown in this demo is in review and could change before it makes it to master.</p>
