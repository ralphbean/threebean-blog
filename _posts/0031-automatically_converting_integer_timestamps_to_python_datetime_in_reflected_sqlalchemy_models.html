title: Automatically converting integer timestamps to python datetime in reflected
  SQLAlchemy models
---
<p>What a title...</p>

<p>I'm working on <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/slurchemy"
  target="_blank">slurchemy</a> and I have a legacy database with tons of tables
(many are dynamically created by another app).  Each table has a few '*_time'
fields that are stored as Integers.  A quick google showed me how to reflect
SQLAlchemy models from the prexisting database, but getting the '*_time' columns
to play out in python as datetime objects (and not as `long`s) was a real
nuisance.</p>

<p>I first tried to use the event framework like so:</p>

$$code(lang=python, style=monokai)
from sqlalchemy import types
from sqlalchemy import event

def listen_for_reflect(table, column_info):
    if 'time' in column_info['name']:
        column_info['type'] = types.DateTime()

event.listen(Table, 'column_reflect', listen_for_reflect)
$$/code

<p>This worked insofar as the Table's column type was really changed to a
<code>sqlalchemy.types.DateTime</code> object in every case I wanted it to.  But
once a <code>sqlalchemy.orm.mapper</code> was applied, my changes weren't
<i>reflected</i>, so to speak.</p>

<p>I banged my head against the sqlalchemy codebase and couldn't make anything
really elegant happen.  Here's what I settled with:</p>

$$code(lang=python, style=monokai)
import datetime
import time

from sqlalchemy import MetaData, Table
from sqlalchemy.orm import scoped_session, class_mapper

def add_datetime_properties(cls):
    """ For every property of a class that contains '_time', add a
    corresponding '_datetime' property that converts to and from seconds 
    since the epoch.

    Use like::
        >>> DBSession = scoped_session(maker)
        >>> DBSession.configure(bind=engine)
        >>> metadata = MetaData(engine.url)
        >>> table = Table('thing_table', metadata, autoload=True)

        >>> class Thing(object):
        ...     pass
        >>> mapper(Thing, table)

        >>> add_datetime_properties(Thing)

        >>> t = DBSession.query(Thing).first()
        >>> print t.create_time
        ... 1314900554
        >>> print t.create_datetime
        ... 2011-09-01 14:09:14
    """

    for prop in class_mapper(cls).iterate_properties:
        if '_time' not in prop.key:
            continue  # Fugheddaboudit

        key = prop.key

        def getx(self):
            return datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(
                float(getattr(self, key)))

        def setx(self, x):
            setattr(self, key, time.mktime(x.timetuple()))

        datetime_key = key.replace('_time', '_datetime')

        setattr(cls, datetime_key, property(getx, setx))
$$/code

<p>And it worked!</p>
