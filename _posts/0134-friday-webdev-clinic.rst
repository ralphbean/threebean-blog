title: Friday Fedora Web Dev Clinic
---

After talking with `mleonova <https://mashaleonova.wordpress.com/>`_ at
`devconf <http://devconf.cz/>`_ the other week, we got the idea in our heads to
hold a weekly "web dev clinic" over video chat for the ``#fedora-apps`` crew.
It will be a video chat lasting ~1 hour, once a week where, if you're working
on Fedora web apps or websites, you can come and either get help on a problem
you're facing, or show off your work, or both.

We're going to try for a first meeting this *coming Friday* at `15:00 UTC
<http://everytimezone.com/#2016-2-26,180,cn3>`_ in `this video channel
<https://meet.jit.si/fedoraapps>`_.  We'll run it a few weeks in a row and see
how it goes.. maybe continue indefinitely?
