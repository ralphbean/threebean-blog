title: fpaste to and from clipboard by hotkey in xmonad
---
<p>I find that in irc, I'm often selecting some code from vim or some shell
output with my mouse, jumping to a browser, loading <a
  href="http://fpaste.org">fpaste.org</a>, pasting the content, clicking submit,
selecting the link/copying it, switching back to IRC and finally pasting the
link.</p>

<p>Jeez.  That's
mouse->keyboard->keyboard->mouse->mouse->mouse->keyboard->mouse.</p>

<p>If you have the fpaste cli tool installed (on Fedora) you can do what I did
and bind a handy keystroke right next to your <a
  href="http://threebean.wordpress.com/2011/03/18/bitlyclip-bitly-ify-whatevers-in-your-x-clipboard/">bitlyclip</a>
binding in your <i>~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs</i> (or whatever window manager config of
your choice).</p>

$$code(lang=haskell, style=monokai)
    ,("C-b", spawn "/usr/bin/bitlyclip")
    ,("C-M-z", spawn "notify-send 'fpasteclip' $(fpaste -i -o)")
    ,("C-M-a", spawn "notify-send 'fpasteclip with python syntax highlighting' $(fpaste -l python -i -o)")
$$/code

<p>Now with <i>ctrl+alt+z</i>, whatever was in your clipboard has been dumped
into fpaste and your clipboard now contains the needed link in one go!</p>
