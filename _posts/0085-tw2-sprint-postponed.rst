title: ToscaWidgets2 Sprint Postponed
---

Last week, `Moritz Schlarb announced
<https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/toscawidgets-discuss/SArSEBQYyiw>`_
a tw2 sprint set for this coming weekend.

Unfortunately, we discovered in ``#toscawidgets`` that we need to reschedule.
The new dates are tentatively set for **August 26th - 28th**, 2013.

If you have any items you want us to take up or you'd like to participate,
please see our `laundry list
<https://github.com/toscawidgets/tw2.core/issues/86>`_.
