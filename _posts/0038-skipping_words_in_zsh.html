title: skipping words in zsh

It boasts a ton of great features including remote tab-completion over ssh under the hood (when trying to remember a path for <i>scp</i> for instance).  It's been great, but the one thing I've been missing is that old word-skipping feature from bash; pressing <code>ctrl-left</code> and <code>ctrl-right</code> is really nice.

After finding (in multiple places) <a href="http://blog.langly.org/2009/10/22/zsh-skipping-words/">cake that was really a lie</a>, I finally found it <a href="http://dotfiles.org/~frogb/.zshrc">commented out at the bottom of a random .zshrc</a>.  I added it to my <code>~/.zshrc.local</code> and am finally in business.
