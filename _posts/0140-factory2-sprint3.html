title: Factory 2.0, Sprint 3 Report
---

<p>This was our first full sprint with the new team!  Welcome, Jan Kaluza,
Courtney Pacheco, Vera Karas, and Stanislav Ochotnicky.  We're glad to have
Filip Valder join us in sprint 4 starting today.</p>
<p>Our top priority in sprint 3 was making sure that the <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BaseRuntime/FAQ">base runtime team</a> isn't blocked.  They have a
big job ahead of themselves to curate and build a collection of base modules at
the core of the distro, and they need to use our prototype build tooling to do
it.  Anytime they're blocked, the Factory 2.0 team is trying to chase down the
solution -- fixing tracebacks and developing new features.  Cheers to Matt
Prahl and Jan Kaluza for staying on top of this.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we're continuing apace with the Dependency Chain and Deserialization
epics that we originally scheduled for work this quarter.  Mike Bonnet has been
chasing down difficult technical pre-requisites for the later (message bus
enablement), Matt Prahl demoed his dependency chain web UI, and Courtney
Pacheco is giving shape to our metrics project (so we can have some confidence
that future pipeline changes we make actually improve the state of affairs).</p>
<p>As always, we're double-tasked with laying the groundwork for work in future
quarters.  Thanks to Stanislav Ochotnicky for starting the conversation with
Platform representatives about workflow changes and continuous integration, and
thanks to all those who participated in this round of resultsdb/CI discussions.</p>

<h2>f26-changes, by threebean</h2>

<p>Here I talk about the <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Policy">Change</a>
proposals we've filed with <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Engineering_Steering_Committee">FESCo</a>
for the Fedora 26 release.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There's one on the <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/ModuleBuildService">module-build-service</a>.</li>
<li>And another on <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/ModularCompose">changes to the compose tooling</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I talk about this in the video, but the changes are designed specifically to
limit the amount of risk we impose on the rest of the release process and the
Modularity initiative.  We can use the F26 release to assess the viability of
Modularity and decide then how far we want to go in the Fedora 27 timeframe.</p>

<h2>mbs-mock-backend, by jkaluza</h2>

<p>In this demo I describe what is Mock Builder and why it is useful to
Module Build Service. I also show it in action briefly.</p>

<h2>pdc-tangle-web, by mprahl</h2>

<p>In this demo I talk about an Angular2 web app I wrote called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/product-definition-center/pdc-tangle-web">PDC Tangle Web</a>. The app queries PDC based on the user's search criteria to show an artifact's dependencies. This is a beta version, so please keep in mind more features will come, but feel free to make suggestions on GitHub for what you'd like to see added.</p>

<h2>resultsdb, by threebean</h2>

<p>This one's just pointing you to a <a class="reference external" href="http://threebean.org/blog/all-hail-resultsdb/">blog post</a> that is a transcription of an
internal document on resultsdb and our plans for it.</p>
<p>I know that showing off a blog post isn't all that exciting, but I'm glad we've
gotten to this point.  It is the product of a long process of discussion and
eventual agreement.</p>
