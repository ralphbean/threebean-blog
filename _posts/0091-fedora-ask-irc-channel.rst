title: New fedora-ask freenode channel (with a bot)
---

If you're in to `Ask Fedora <https://ask.fedoraproject.org>`_, you may
want to hop on to freenode and join the new ``#fedora-ask`` channel.  There's a
bot there echoing just the Ask Fedora activity from `fedmsg
<http://fedmsg.com>`_.  You could use it, say, to respond more quickly to
questions or to stay abrest of new trending problems.
