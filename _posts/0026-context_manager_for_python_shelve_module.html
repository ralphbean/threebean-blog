title: Context manager for python shelve module
---
<p>Getting in the flow of using context managers is great.</p>
$$code(lang=python, style=monokai)
# This feels really old.
f = open('foo.txt')
handle_file(f)
f.close()

# This feels really great.
with open('foo.txt') as f:
    handle_file(f)
$$/code

<p>Python's <code>shelve</code> module doesn't seem to be up to date; I get so
frustrated whenever I try to use it inside <code>with</code> syntax and am
refused.</p>

<p>I fixed the problem!</p>

$$code(lang=python, style=monokai)
import shelve

class cmshelve(object):
    """ Context manager for shelve """

    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename

    def __enter__(self):
        self.obj = shelve.open(self.filename)
        return self.obj

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        self.obj.close()
$$/code

<p>You can use it a little something like this</p>


$$code(lang=python, style=monokai)
>>> with cmshelve('foo.db') as d:
...     d['foo'] = "bar"
...     print d
{'foo': 'bar'}

>>> # This proves that the shelve was actually closed
>>> print d
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
ValueError: invalid operation on closed shelf

>>> # And as you'd expect, you can go back and re-open it just fine
>>> with cmshelve('foo.db') as d:
...     print d
{'foo': 'bar'}
$$/code
