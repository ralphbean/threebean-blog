I'm moving!  Today is my first day on the Release Engineering Development team
(RED team) of the PnT DevOps organization at Red Hat.  After I get my bearings,
I'll be working on "Factory 2.0" which, while still quite a nebulous and undefined
thing, boils down to focusing on the next-generation build and release pipeline
for RHEL and other Red Hat products.  What's cool about this is that, since
it's future-facing work, I get to focus on how to knit the effort with what's
been going on in Fedora releng.  We'll have lots to talk about and hack on, I'm
sure.
