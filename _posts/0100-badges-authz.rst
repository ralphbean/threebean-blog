title: Badges Authz Feature
---

A quick note:  a new release of the `Fedora Badges app
<https://badges.fedoraproject.org>`_ went out before the holidays.  The main
new feature is some authorization code that allows us to grant particular users
the rights to award particular badges.

This will make some new stuff possible.  For instance, the `Beat Writer badges
<https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/working-a-beat-beat-writer-i>`_ are to
be awarded to people who take on the writing of a `documentation "beat"
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Category:Documentation_beats>`_.  We don't
really have a way to measure that programmatically.  With the new authorization
code, we can authorize `randomuser/immanetize
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Immanetize>`_, the docs project lead, to
award those badges as makes sense.
Similarly, we have authorized `patches
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Patches>`_ to hand out the `Web Warrior
<https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/web-warrior>`_ and `Write Stuff
<https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/the-write-stuff>`_ badges.

More to come...  If you haven't noticed, `riecatnor
<http://riecatnor.wordpress.com/>`_ is doing some prodigious work on new
badge art.
