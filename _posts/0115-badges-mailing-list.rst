Want to help with the future direction of `Fedora Badges
<https://badges.fedoraproject.org>`_ and don't know where to start?  One place
we really need help is with the triaging, review, and conceptual work that goes
into cooking up new badges.

It *used* to be that we had a real bottleneck.  New badge ideas would be
submitted to the `fedora-badges trac <https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-badges>`_
but notifications of updates there (fresh insights, elaborations, requests for
clarifications, etc..) would only be sent to members of the ``sysadmin-badges``
group (a small but sturdy crew).

Earlier this month, we `hooked up trac notifications to the badges mailing list
<https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/badges/2014-August/000021.html>`_
opening the door to broader participating -- you can now `subscribe
<https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/badges>`_ and take an active
part in determining the future direction of the system!

**NOTE** -- Your action must be born of intrinsic motivation.  There is no
badge for joining the mailing list.  I'm sorry.
