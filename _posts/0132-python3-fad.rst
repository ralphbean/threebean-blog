title: Upcoming Python3 Porting vFAD
---

All thanks to `Abdel Mart√≠nez <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Potty>`_ and
`Matej Stuchlik <Matej Stuchlik>`_, we're going to be holding a `(virtual)
international "Fedora Activity Day" for Python 3 porting
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAD_Python_3_Porting_2015>`_, and it is going
to be amazing.  Save the date -- **November 14th and 15th**

Things to consider:

- If you haven't heard, 2016 is going to be the year of Python3 on the desktop, so...

- If you **don't know what you're doing with Python3 porting**, don't sweat it.
  If you want to learn, come join and we'll try to teach you along the way.

- If you **don't know how to submit patches upstream**, don't sweat it.  If you
  want to learn, come join and we'll try to teach you along the way.

- If you want to hack with us, add your info to `the wiki page
  <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAD_Python_3_Porting_2015#Planning>`_.  We'll
  be hanging out in a opentokrtc channel and in ``#fedora-python`` on freenode.
  See `the details
  <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAD_Python_3_Porting_2015#Communication_Channels>`_.

- We have a `really cool webapp <http://portingdb-encukou.rhcloud.com/>`_ that
  `Petr Viktorin <http://encukou.cz/>`_ put together.  It tracks the status of
  different packages in Fedora and upstream so we can coordinate more
  effectively about what needs to be done.

- If you want to get people in your city together, that can make it more fun.
  You can join the video chat as a group! The EMEA crew will be online from the
  `Pycon CZ 2015 <https://cz.pycon.org/2015/>`_ sprints (cool).  There are a
  couple people from my local Python User Group that want to join in.. although
  we're still searching for a reasonable place to meet up.  I plan to be around
  starting at 18:00 UTC both days, although I bet EMEA crew will be online much
  earlier.

Happy Hacking
