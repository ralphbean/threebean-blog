title: Going to Flock?  10 things to do in Rochester
---

We're `less than a week out from Fedora Flock 2015 in Rochester
<https://major.io/2015/08/06/less-than-a-week-until-fedora-flock-2015/>`_.
We're going to be super busy with planned sessions and hackfests during the day
and parties at night, but if you find yourself with some downtime or
if you just need a breather, here are some things around `the Flower City
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_New_York>`_ to check out.

Daytime things
--------------

**#1** Walk to `Hart's local grocers <https://hartslocalgrocers.com/>`_ (`map1 <https://goo.gl/maps/oo1z8>`_) for anything you might need.  They have good prepared food and all sorts of fresh fixin's.

**#2** Especially the vegetarians, check out `Orange Glory <http://orangeglorycafe.com/>`_ (`map2 <https://goo.gl/maps/bO13b>`_) for a sandwich wonderland (they have some meaty sandwiches too, fwiw).

**#3** Get your fancy coffees at `Java's Cafe <http://www.javascafe.com/pages/about.html>`_
(`map3 <https://goo.gl/maps/WflWY>`_).  It's a great spot (and my partner works
there so be nice!)

**#4** `High Falls <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Falls_(Rochester,_New_York)>`_ doesn't hold a candle to Niagara Falls, but it's still pretty cool.  There's a good view from the walkable Genesee Brew House (`map4 <https://goo.gl/maps/F8LOD>`_) (which has good beer and food).

**#5** Take a walk in Mount Hope Cemetery (`map5 <https://goo.gl/maps/uCXtp>`_) It's a
beautiful 200 acres, home to such notable burials as Frederick Douglass
and Susan B. Anthony.

**#6** The super adventurous types might want to explore Rochester's `abandoned subway system <http://rocwiki.org/Abandoned_Subway>`_, although you'll have to find an entrance -- not for the faint of heart.

Nighttime things
----------------

**#7** Beer lovers should almost certainly visit `the Old Toad <http://theoldtoad.com/beer.html>`_ (`map7 <https://goo.gl/maps/W4RcJ>`_).  A walk there is worth it (and there are lots of other bars and clubs nearby in the `"East End" <http://rocwiki.org/East_End>`_).

**#8** Nearby is the `Skylark Lounge <http://www.theskylarklounge.com/>`_ (`map8 <https://goo.gl/maps/DoyAV>`_).  I'm not even kidding when I say they have the best meatballs in the city.

**#9** Eat a `garbage plate <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/26/garbage-plate_n_4854514.html>`_, preferably late at night.  The best ones are at Mark's Texas Hots (`map9 <https://goo.gl/maps/VTHs4>`_).

**#10** Lastly, you can eat a more-than-reasonable amount of pulled pork at `Dinosaur Bar-B-Que <http://rocwiki.org/Dinosaur_Bar-B-Que>`_ (`map10 <https://goo.gl/maps/BgPFP>`_).
