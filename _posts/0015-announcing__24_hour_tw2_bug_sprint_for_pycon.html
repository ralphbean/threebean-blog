<p><span style="font-family: Courier,Monospaced;"><span style="font-family: Courier,Monospaced;">(First published to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/toscawidgets-discuss/browse_frm/thread/6e86a530e6895394" target="_blank">toscawidgets-discuss google group</a>)<br /></span></span></p>
<p>It came up in IRC the other day that <a href="http://tw2core.rtfd.org/" target="_blank" title="tw2 documentation">tw2</a> has been through many, many beta iterations.  So many in fact, that a full on tw2 2.0 release is painfully overdue.</p>
<p>That said, there are still plenty of out-standing issues in our issue tracker: <br />     <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://bitbucket.org/paj/tw2core&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCqZoRaKpt0CizIMCGknpn9NWRcg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bitbucket.org/paj/tw2core</a></p>
<p>Before we tag and name the 2.0 final product, I'm proposing -- no, announcing -- a 24 hour tw2 sprint the weekend before PyCon.  We'll write docs, we'll automate tests, we'll settle the dispatch dispute and wax philosophic.</p>
<p>I invite you to join me Saturday, March 3rd at 18:00:00 UTC through Sunday, March 4th 18:00:00 UTC.  Hop into #toscawidgets on freenode or join me in a hangout on google plus.  We'll nail every last bug on deck and still have time for a beer.</p>
<p>Yours in widgetry-</p>
