title: The Embryonic Fedora RPG

Just writing to bump `oddshock's quite active yet hitherto unsung blog
<http://oddshocks.com/blog/>`_.  He's writing prolifically on the design process
for the Fedora RPG and it's really interesting to follow.

You can find him and the rest of that team on freenode in ``#rit-foss``.
