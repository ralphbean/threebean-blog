title: Tutorial - locally consuming messages from the staging FAS
---

`herlo <http://sexysexypenguins.com/>`_ was asking in ``#fedora-devel``
about consuming `fedmsg <http://fedmsg.rtfd.org>`_ messages from FAS.
He pointed out that while there is `documentation about consuming messages
<http://fedmsg.readthedocs.org/en/latest/consuming/>`_, there's also a lot of
stuff going on.  Most importantly, an introduction to the workflow is missing.

So, here's `a tutorial I made in response <http://bit.ly/QrDhZZ>`_ that should
walk you through it.  Its a little verbose *and* a little rough around the edges
(the line-wrapping gets wonky in places) but I think it will still serve the
purpose.  If it raises new questions or comments, please bring them up in
the comment thread here, on the `messaging-sig mailing list
<https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/messaging-sig>`_, or in
``#fedora-apps`` on freenode.

Static files created in that tutorial can be found in and downloaded from
`this gist <https://gist.github.com/3766683>`_.
