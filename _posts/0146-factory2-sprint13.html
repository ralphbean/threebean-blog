title: Factory 2, Sprint 13
---

<p>The Factory 2.0 team is plugging along on a design phase for our next set of
projects in the F27 timeframe.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <em>WaiverDB</em> prototype is done (a key component in our vision for CI/CD).
Next steps here are to have our technical fellows review the prototype and
make sure it will meet our needs.  We'll be aiming for production deployment
soon after that (so we can iterate as needed).</li>
<li>The design work for <em>Arbitrary Branching</em> and <em>Automated Rebuilds</em> is nearing
completion.  We'll be planning out prototype work for those in the coming
sprints.</li>
<li>Our design for <em>PolicyEngine</em> and <em>Module Updates</em> are both still cooking.
Expect to see conclusions to their design phases in the next few sprints.</li>
</ul>



<h2>arbitrary-branches-fedora-focus-doc, by mprahl</h2>

<p>This demo discusses the concept of âArbitrary Branching&quot; (package dist-git branches) and how that is a requirement for Fedora 27 to be a fully modularized operating system. It also elaborates on the high-level changes that will need to take place for this to become a reality.</p>

<h2>waiverdb-prototype, by mjia</h2>

<p>In this demo I describe the background of WaiverDB, what problems it solved,
showing how to use the HTTP APIs to manage the waivers.</p>
